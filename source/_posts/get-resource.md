* Ok, the installation stage is finished, you can start download resources!

## 3. Browse http://douban.com/ to search and download your resource!

* For example, you want to get a book associated with **machine learning**, you just need to search it in douban books.

* Then, if you want to download the machine learning book with flowers on its cover :), click it and go into the item page. Notice, the scrip installed just now uses multi-thread and is memory-consuming, so your browser may be stuck there for a little while, that’s normal and don’t shut down the tab!

* Then you will notice that on the right of the page, you can see resources from any website. The script will detect whether the resource exists, and display the result in different color. Light blue ones mean that you can find resources by visiting this link, while yellow ones tell you that this certain resource doesn't exist here. And these websites are classified, so if you have a certain preference, just follow the label and you will get what you want!
