# Useful Words

* 电信学院：School of Electronic Information and Communication

* 光电学院：School of Optical and Electronic Information

* 由…组成：be composed of/ be made up of 

* 种子班：Undergraduate Program for Advanced Project-based Information Science Education (Seeds Class)

  <!-- more -->

* 串联：series connection

* 并联：parallel connection

* *Transverse electromagnetic* (*TEM*) *modes*:neither electric nor magnetic field in the direction of propagation. The direction of it is perpendicular to electric field and magnetic field.

  横电磁波：电场和磁场的振动在电磁波传播方向上都没有投影分量。（电场和磁场的振动方向都垂直于电磁波的传播方向）

* KCL：Kirchhoff's circuit laws. Kirchhoff's circuit laws are two equalities that deal with the current and potential difference (commonly known as voltage) in the lumped element model of electrical circuits. They were first described in 1845 by German physicist Gustav Kirchhoff. **At any node (junction) in an electrical circuit, the sum of currents flowing into that node is equal to the sum of currents flowing out of that node.**

  *The algebraic sum of currents in a network of conductors meeting at a point is zero.*

* KVL：The directed sum of the electrical potential differences (voltage) around any closed network is zero

* 戴维南电路：Thévenin's theorem：Any linear electrical network with voltage and current sources and resistances only can be replaced at terminals A-B by an equivalent voltage source Vth in series connection with an equivalent resistance Rth.

  The equivalent voltage Vth is the voltage obtained at terminals A-B of the network with terminals A-B open circuited.

  The equivalent resistance Rth is the resistance that the circuit between terminals A and B would have if all ideal voltage sources in the circuit were replaced by a short circuit and all ideal current sources were replaced by an open circuit.

* 诺顿定理：Any linear electrical network with voltage and current sources and only resistances can be replaced at terminals A–B by an equivalent current source Ino in parallel connection with an equivalent resistance Rno.

  This equivalent current Ino is the current obtained at terminals A-B of the network with terminals A-B short circuited.

  This equivalent resistance Rno is the resistance obtained at terminals A-B of the network with all its voltage sources short circuited and all its current sources open circuited.

# Self Introduction

I am Zhongyang Zhang, a Junior student from Electronic and Information Engineering of HUST. I'm from the school of electronic information and communication and my major is seed class. It might sound like a little puzzling, but in fact it is the name of Advanced Project-based Information Science Education Class. As for relevant courses, I've learned Electromagnetic Field and wave, communication Electronic Circuits last year.

Besides, I have the ability of quick learning. You know, the first program I've participated in after I've been a member of Seed Class is a project which need us to develop a iOS Software for a commercial company, although I've never developed a app since I only have a little knowledge on C language , I exerted myself and learned how to handle it well by studying objective C via internet. Also, I adapt myself to python and machine learning afterwards smoothly despite the fact that I didn't satisfy much of the pre-requisite. 

And also, I am familiar with hardware, too. I've learned how to draw a PCB board in my previous courses and I'm trying to make a game box for a certain game named “Dont stop！Quaver” recently.

My hobby is learning foreign language and management. I can speak fluent Japanese and I also learned basic French.
